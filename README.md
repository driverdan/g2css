# G2CSS

G2CSS converts gradient images to CSS gradients in the browser.

G2CSS makes heavy use of [Billy Hoffman's ImageG2CSS's code](http://zoompf.com/grad2css.html) which, in turn, is based on [Philip Tellis' pngtocss](https://github.com/bluesmoon/pngtocss). Thanks to both!

## Use

G2CSS requires a browser that supports the File API. It currently works in Chrome and Firefox 4. The CSS Gradient example box doesn't work in FF.
